            <h2>The Questionnaire</h2>
            <p class="long">The quiz is designed to quickly screen for the unknown presence of certain mental health conditions. 26% of the population is estimated to have a mental health condition, yet only 20% of the population has a mental health diagnosis. That difference suggests there is common prevalence of undiagnosed mental health conditions.</p>
